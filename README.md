## Why I develop a Swagger Viewer from scrach

A couple of weeks ago, in order to meet the special needs of my project, I extended a path rewrite function to [Intelliji Swagger](https://github.com/zalando/intellij-swagger) consumed by Webstorm.
Unfortunately, WebStorm is very slow in my daily use and can't guarantee my development efficiency. Therefore, I switched from WebStorm to VS Code recently. Although VS Code has many shortcomings compared to IntelliJ products, its Remote development function has greatly improved my development efficiency. Therefore, I need a VS Code extension similar to [intellij-swagger](https://github.com/zalando/intellij-swagger). At present, the two popular extensions to preview Swagger/OpenAPI definition.

-   [Swagger Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer)
-   [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)

However, they can't meet my special scenario where I need a path rewrite rule to make preview working. In the end, I decided to build my own VS Code extension for the following reasons:

1. I need to support path rewrite, which is not supported by current popular extensions.
2. I can directly modify one of the popular extensions, just like I modified IntelliJ Swagger before. However, its code quality did not meet my expectations.
